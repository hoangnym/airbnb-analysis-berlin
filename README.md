- airbnb-analysis-berlin.ipynb ==> Notebook to investigate trends in price, number of bookings and prices for listings  on Airbnb in the years 2019 and 2020 in Berlin.

## Motivation
Working on these aspects related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used:
- Prices Overview
- Listings count Overview
- Find busiest time of the year for this city
- Occupancy rate and Number of reviews over time
- Impact of Corona virus on listings and prices

## Results
- The **average price** of an airbnb listing in Berlin is cheaper than for a hotel room. 
- Usually (2019 data), most of the properties are booked and/or unvailable (>80%) already, making the Berlin Airbnb market very attractive to prospective hosts.
- Due to the sudden impact of Covid-19 (2020 data), this picture has changed. Now around 70% only are occupied, leaving a market oversupply of over 10% compared to last year.
- Property Price highly depends on the **neighbourhood**, the location where it is situated. `Charlottenburg` in Berlin's most luxurious area.
- Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and Pankow offer the largest amount of listings, making it at the same time the most reasonably priced ones.
- The most **popular airbnb apartment sizes** in Berlin are listings for `2 to 4 occupants`. 
- Tourist prefer to rent an entire apartments over a private room. 
- In total, over 95% of listings are entire apartments or private rooms. Little than 5% are shared rooms or hotel rooms.
